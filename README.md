## üß† Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my ongoing machine learning projects ‚Äî from foundational algorithm implementations to applied experiments. It also tracks my progress through a structured deep learning roadmap based on PyTorch.

### üìÅ Projects Included

#### 1. **LEGO Price Prediction (Applied ML)**

- Applied and evaluated multiple regression models to predict LEGO set prices using features like number of pieces, release year, and number of minifigures.
- Performed preprocessing using min-max scaling and log transformation.
- Used scikit-learn for training and visualized results.

#### 2. **Micrograd (Autograd from Scratch)**

- Implemented a minimal scalar-based autograd engine in Python.
- Supports computational graph creation and reverse-mode differentiation.
- Mimics core PyTorch functionality at a low level.

#### 3. **makemore ‚Äì Part 1 (Bigram Language Model)**

- Implemented a character-level bigram model to generate names.
- Trained on a name dataset to learn character transitions.
- First part of a full deep learning series on text generation.

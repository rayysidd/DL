üß† Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains my ongoing machine learning projects ‚Äî from foundational algorithm implementations to practical applications. Each project focuses on a core concept, helping build a deep understanding of ML systems from the ground up.

‚úÖ Currently includes: regression models on real-world data, custom autograd engine, and a character-level bigram language model.

üìÅ Projects Included
1. LEGO Price Prediction (Applied ML)
Applied and evaluated multiple regression models to predict LEGO set prices using features like number of pieces, release year, and number of minifigures.

Performed preprocessing with min-max scaling and log transformation.

Trained models using scikit-learn and visualized performance metrics.

2. micrograd Clone (Autograd from Scratch)
Implemented a minimal scalar-based autograd engine in Python to support reverse-mode differentiation.

Built foundational components such as Value objects, computational graph construction, and backward pass.

Serves as the computational core for basic neural nets.

3. makemore ‚Äì Part 1 (Bigram Language Model)
Implemented a character-level bigram model to generate names, following the first part of Andrej Karpathy's makemore series.

Used basic probability and statistics to build the model without deep learning frameworks.

Trained on a small dataset of names to learn character-to-character transitions.
